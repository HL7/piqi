####The General Use Case for a Patient Data Quality Scoring Framework
In healthcare, both human providers, and the software intended to support them, have a critical reliance on the availability of complete, correct and current information.  In order to provide this information we as an industry have spent decades laying the groundwork to support interoperability between healthcare applications, The messaging standards, standard terminologies and implementation guides are all a part of ths foundation.  The last barrier to interoperability is trust, the trust that the data that we are receiving has a level of quality that will support our use cases and not confound them.  The PIQI Framework is intended to provide a standard, community-based approach to evaluating the usability of data with a goal of transcending the siloed, subject idea of data quality. The flexibility of the approach articulates a methodology for quality measurement that can be applied across different context and provide qualitative guidance tailored to variouls implementation of interoperable exchnage.  The PIQI framework attempts to do this across the family of HL7 products to not just support the current state of the industry but also it's evolution over time.

#### Data Quality in Quality Measurement - Ben Hamlin
High data quality is crucial for The Joint Commission's quality measures used in accreditation and certification programs. Accurate and reliable data ensure that healthcare organizations are evaluated fairly and consistently, leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced operational efficiency. From The Joint Commission's perspective, high-quality data is essential for tying clinical care to quality improvement initiatives. This connection helps identify areas needing improvement, track progress over time, and implement evidence-based practices to enhance patient care. However, several prevalent pain points arise from poor data quality. These include data fragmentation, where information is scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of patient care. Inconsistent data entry practices lead to errors and discrepancies, undermining the reliability of the data. Outdated systems hinder seamless data integration, causing delays and inefficiencies. Additionally, the lack of standardized data formats and the challenge of maintaining data integrity across various platforms pose significant obstacles. By ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of data used in Joint Commission quality measures, healthcare organizations can support better care for individuals, improved health for populations, and lower healthcare costs.
