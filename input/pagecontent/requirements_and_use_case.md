#### The General Use Case for a Patient Data Quality Scoring Framework
In healthcare, both human providers and the software systems that support them critically depend on the availability of complete, correct, and current information. To provide this information, our industry has spent decades building the foundational infrastructure for interoperability between healthcare applications. Messaging standards, standard terminologies, and implementation guides all form part of this foundation. However, the last barrier to true interoperability is trustâ€”specifically, trust that the data we receive meets the quality standards necessary to support our use cases rather than undermine them.
The PIQI Framework is designed to provide a standardized, community-based approach to evaluating data usability, with the goal of transcending siloed, subjective approaches to data quality assessment. The framework's flexible methodology enables quality measurement across different contexts while providing qualitative guidance tailored to various implementations of interoperable data exchange. By working across the family of HL7 products, the PIQI Framework supports not only the current state of the industry but also its evolution over time.

#### Data Quality in Quality Measurement - Ben Hamlin
High data quality is crucial for The Joint Commission's quality measures used in accreditation and certification programs. Accurate and reliable data ensure that healthcare organizations are evaluated fairly and consistently, leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced operational efficiency. From The Joint Commission's perspective, high-quality data is essential for tying clinical care to quality improvement initiatives. This connection helps identify areas needing improvement, track progress over time, and implement evidence-based practices to enhance patient care. However, several prevalent pain points arise from poor data quality. These include data fragmentation, where information is scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of patient care. Inconsistent data entry practices lead to errors and discrepancies, undermining the reliability of the data. Outdated systems hinder seamless data integration, causing delays and inefficiencies. Additionally, the lack of standardized data formats and the challenge of maintaining data integrity across various platforms pose significant obstacles. By ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of data used in Joint Commission quality measures, healthcare organizations can support better care for individuals, improved health for populations, and lower healthcare costs.
