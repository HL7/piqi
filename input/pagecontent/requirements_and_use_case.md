#### The General Use Case for a Patient Data Quality Scoring Framework
In healthcare, both human providers and the software systems that support them critically depend on the availability of complete, correct, and current information. To provide this information, our industry has spent decades building the foundational infrastructure for interoperability between healthcare applications. Messaging standards, standard terminologies, and implementation guides all form part of this foundation. However, the last barrier to true interoperability is trust—specifically, trust that the data we receive meets the quality standards necessary to support our use cases rather than undermine them.

The PIQI Framework is designed to provide a standardized, community-based approach to evaluating data usability, with the goal of transcending siloed, subjective approaches to data quality assessment. The framework's flexible methodology enables quality measurement across different contexts while providing qualitative guidance tailored to various implementations of interoperable data exchange. By working across the family of HL7 products, the PIQI Framework supports not only the current state of the industry but also its evolution over time.

#### Data Quality in Quality Measurement and Quality Improvement
Methods for assessing healthcare quality are rapidly evolving to become more patient-focused and more meaningful in supporting quality improvement. Recent advancements in digital data and measurement standards have made this evolution possible, but the accelerated deployment of digital quality measures (dQMs) present several challenges despite their many benefits. Electronic clinical datasets offer many opportunities for assessing a variety of patient outcomes, however measuring quality of care is particularly reliant on the transformation of the data to a standardized format useable by a dQM. dQMs require standard data stored using common data interoperability definitions and preferred terminologies (codes) that represent the warehoused knowledge in a manner that can be directly queried by the dQM for clinical performance assessment. The need for standardized data to assess healthcare quality has resulted in formation of central data repositories (CDRs) for the explicit purpose of aggregating, deduplicating and normalizing patient data from multiple systems to support both research and digital quality measurement. Extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) patient data from multiple systems into a dQM-compatible CDR is subject to rigorous evaluation to ensure that, as the information is being transformed, the integrity of the original data is preserved. The criteria for evaluation of these data in CDRs lacks an authoritative source, or gold standard reference, that explicitly defines those fitness expectations critical to assert that the data is adequate for use by quality measurement programs. The PIQI framework enables highly reliable data quality assessments that can be applied universally, irrespective of the data source.

The Joint Commission stewards a variety of structure, process and outcome quality measures used across their accreditation and certification programs. Having accurate and reliable data ensure that healthcare organizations are evaluated fairly and consistently, leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced operational efficiency. From The Joint Commission's perspective, high-quality data is essential for tying clinical care to quality improvement initiatives. This connection helps identify areas needing improvement, track progress over time, and implement evidence-based practices to enhance patient care. However, several prevalent pain points arise from poor data quality. These include data fragmentation, where information is scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of patient care. Inconsistent data entry practices lead to errors and discrepancies, undermining the reliability of the data. Outdated systems hinder seamless data integration, causing delays and inefficiencies. Additionally, the lack of standardized data formats and the challenge of maintaining data integrity across various platforms pose significant obstacles. Eensuring accurate, consistent, and complete data is used for quality measurement, ensuring healthcare organizations accredited by the Joint Commission can support better care for individuals, improved health for populations, and lower healthcare costs.

#### Clinical Care and CDS - NCQA/CDS/IPRO
Large difference in data quality requirements/expectations for QM/QI vs CDS 
- CDS has a much higher bar for trustworthy data than dQMs as life-or-death decisions may be made from information produced by CDS
- CDS are scraping or “hooking” data in real time from data directly entered into the active medical record.  
 - Not subject to in-line data quality assessments at data entry, only in secondary use, post-encounter correction (by patient or a member of the care team) or as part of audit reconciliation
- Necessitates DQA models like PIQI to be deployed at the structural design level of the EMR
 - AI deployed to “correct” notes as they are entered in MR by clinician and/or patient (dictation, etc.)
 - Restricting data entry to pre-defined fields by vendor to only allow use of structured fields (high burden on clinical workflow, increased frustration by patients when fields do not align with the information they wish to enter)

#### Public Health - CDC?
#### Regulatory
Regulatory bodies depend on high-quality, high-integrity real-world data to make informed decisions that significantly impact public health and safety. The integrity and quality of this data are crucial, as they ensure that the information used is accurate, reliable, and trustworthy. This foundation is essential for making sound decisions regarding the approval, recall, and monitoring of clinical devices and products, ultimately safeguarding patients from potential harm.
 
High-quality data allows regulatory bodies to effectively reuse information across various scenarios, enhancing their decision-making processes. In value-based care, accurate data is vital for evaluating patient outcomes and controlling costs. Reliable data is also critical in product approvals and recalls, ensuring that only safe and effective products reach the market. Post-market surveillance depends on high-quality data to continuously monitor the safety and efficacy of products. Additionally, population health reporting and analytics require precise data to identify trends and inform public health strategies. By maintaining the highest data quality standards, regulatory bodies can better protect and promote public health across these diverse areas.
 
#### Payers
Data integration and interoperability are top priorities for healthcare payers, but integrating data from diverse sources remains a complex challenge. Health insurance payers face costly data quality issues that impact member management, claims processing, regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.

Payers rely upon data obtained from diverse sources, each often acquired in unique formats (e.g., flat files, CSV, non-standard XML, JSON, EDI standards) using a variety of vocabularies (proprietary and terminology standards) which require significant transformation to aggregate, analyze and exchange these data.

Payers receive data in a variety of healthcare exchange and terminology standards formats including HL7 FHIR, C-CDA’s and Version 2, EDI X12N, ICD, CPT and HCPCS, SNOMED CT, and LOINC. Payers use healthcare data submitted by providers to evaluate requests for prior authorization and to accurately adjudicate healthcare claims. In addition, these data are used to show that quality measures are being addressed as well as to ensure that appropriate Risk Adjustments are applied to their members.

The availability of consistent, accurate, and plausible data are paramount to correct outcomes for all of these use cases.
The primary data quality issues that confront healthcare payers include:
·            **Missing, incomplete data** such as key fields in patient demographics, provider identifiers, and claim details (Availability)
·            **Inaccurate, incorrect data**, including incorrect provider directory information, incorrect claims coding (Accuracy)
·            **Data inconsistency** where clinical data across sources, may be inconsistent such as when diagnosis codes in claims do not match those in the accompanying clinical documentation, or where dates-of-service or procedures that precede a member’s date of birth, or indicate overlapping inpatient stays at different facilities (Plausibility)
·            **Invalid, Incompatible, or Non-Standard Code Systems**, including the use of diagnosis or procedure codes that are no longer valid, when the code system provided is not an agreed upon code system, or when the code is not a member of the provided code system (Conformity)

The PIQI Framework can significantly address the critical need for consistent, high-quality, and interoperable patient information that healthcare care payers obtain from diverse data sources using PIQI standardized data assessments to identify specific issues affecting data integrity, accuracy, conformity, and availability. The PIQI can provide detailed insight into the root causes of specific data quality issues and provides a feedback loop to help data sources adjust their processes to meet quality requirements and improve overall data quality. These improvements are useful to payers, healthcare providers, and most importantly to the people they serve.

#### EHRs - Gary Dickinson + Clinical Architecture
Measuring and understanding objective quality is relevent for EHRs both when they are receiving to sharing patient information. When an EHR receives patient data from another healthcare system during hospital transfers, specialist referrals, or lab result transmissions, PIQI could evaluate the incoming data quality in real-time before incorporation into the patient record, preventing poor-quality data from contaminating the EHR and alerting clinicians to potential reliability issues. Additionally, healthcare organizations could use PIQI to assess their interoperability readiness before participating in health information exchanges or implementing new connections, ensuring their EHR's outgoing data meets quality standards expected by receiving systems, which is particularly relevant for USCDI compliance and information blocking regulations. The framework also enables vendor performance monitoring, allowing organizations to objectively measure the quality of data coming from different EHR modules, third-party applications, or data sources, providing metrics for vendor accountability while identifying which systems consistently provide high-quality versus problematic data. Finally, as data quality becomes increasingly important for regulatory programs like Medicare reporting, public health surveillance, and quality measures, EHRs could use PIQI to ensure outgoing data meets regulatory quality standards before submission. The key advantage of PIQI in these EHR scenarios is that it evaluates data quality "in flight" without storing PHI, making it suitable for real-time assessment during the normal flow of clinical operations rather than requiring separate data quality analysis processes.
