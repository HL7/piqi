### Introduction

This Implementation Guide (IG) describes the Patient Information Quality Improvement Framework or PIQI (pronounced ‘picky’) Framework creates a standard approach for patient-centric health care information that prioritizes portability and reusability, enabling seamless integration into various systems irrespective of the data source. Health care data can be complex, heterogeneous, and dispersed across various systems and platforms. Moreover, the traditional database-centric approach often restricts the flexibility and portability required to accommodate the intricate nuances of patient-centric healthcare information. 

Data fitness is a specific construct of data quality where determination of data’s appropriateness
for use in a specific context is ultimately declared by the person (data consumer) responsible for
evaluating whether a dataset is adequate for its intended purpose. Evaluators of data fitness
frequently do not have the requisite contextual basis to enable a judgement on a particular
dataset, rendering the data inutile despite its potential to inform care quality. The data quality
knowledge presented to an evaluator must have a high level of face validity to that
person—which assumes the information presents a complete and accurate picture of their
expectations for the data’s use.

Shifting the focus to standardized patient-centric information quality assessment models, tthje PIQI framework aims to enhance data quality at the structural, or data element level. Providing prespecified parameters for a simplified structural analysis increases the certainty and usability of healthcare data, empowering health care organizations to make well informed decisions quickly that ultimately provide improved patient care. The PIQI Framework provides the ability to assess data against standard models, such as USCDI v3, generating scorecards, and providing insights from the quality assessment process important to end users trusting the data is of sufficient quality.
